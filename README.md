# Rock Paper Scissors

##

Rock paper scissors game in browser.
Used HTML, CSS & Javascript

What troubled me the most was the tracking and updating scores. I also had trouble getting computer choice to be reselected after every round.

I would like to add transitions and sounds to this project in the future.
